    <h1>Child Components</h1>
    <p>In React, the concept of parent and child components is foundational. The parent component contains one or more
        child
        components, allowing you to break down complex UIs into more manageable, reusable pieces.</p>
    <p>From your given code, it looks like you have a parent component named <code>Home</code> that is designed to
        receive a
        child component through its props and then render that child. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use parent
        and
        child components based on your example:</p>
    <h2>1. Creating a Child Component:</h2>
    <p>Let's create a simple child component named <code>Greeting</code>.</p>
    <pre>
    import React from 'react';

    const Greeting: React.FC = () => {
        return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }

    export default Greeting;
</pre>
    <h2>2. Using the Child Component in the Parent:</h2>
    <p>You can include the <code>Greeting</code> component as a child inside the <code>Home</code> component.</p>
    <pre>
    import React from 'react';
    import Greeting from './Greeting'; // Assuming Greeting is in the same directory

    const Home: React.FC = () => {
        return (
           &lt;Home child=&lt;Greeting /&gt; /&gt;
        );
    }

    export default Home;
</pre>
    <h2>3. Passing Child Components using Props:</h2>
    <p>Instead of directly placing the child component inside the parent in the manner shown above, you can pass it as a
        prop (like how your <code>Home</code> component expects it).</p>
    <pre>
    import React from 'react';
    import Home from './Home';
    import Greeting from './Greeting';

    const App: React.FC = () => {
        return &lt;Home child=&lt;Greeting /&gt; /&gt;;
    }

    export default App;
</pre>
    <h2>4. Using <code>children</code> Prop:</h2>
    <p>React has a special prop called <code>children</code> which can be used to pass child components in between
        opening
        and closing tags of the parent component.</p>
    <p>Update <code>Home</code> component to make use of <code>children</code>:</p>
    <pre>
    import React from 'react';

    const Home: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
        return &lt;&gt;{children}&lt;/&gt;;
    }

    export default Home;
</pre>
    <p>Using the <code>children</code> prop in the <code>App</code> component:</p>
    <pre>
    import React from 'react';
    import Home from './Home';
    import Greeting from './Greeting';

    const App: React.FC = () => {
        return (
            &lt;Home&gt;
                &lt;Greeting /&gt;
            &lt;/Home&gt;
        );
    }

    export default App;
</pre>
    <p>In this approach, anything you place between the opening and closing tags of <code>&lt;Home&gt;</code> will be
        passed
        as the <code>children</code> prop. This makes it more flexible and intuitive for developers to use.</p>
    <p>Remember, the key to effectively using parent and child components in React is understanding props and how data
        can
        be passed down from parent to child. It helps in building modular and reusable components, leading to cleaner
        and
        more maintainable code.</p>
